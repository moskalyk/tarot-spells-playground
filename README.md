# tarot aqua spells
using a local physical deck to assemble lore, transposed to aqua-like spells that could be run on a timelike schedule (dreams, morning, evening, seasonal, etc.)

# peers
peers could be assembled from archetypes from favourite games, industry, or consented internet or local friends

# dev notes
as a first attempt, some assumptions were made about passing context and results from service runs. standardization for what this looks like in a compute environment could be useful

# background
aqua spells run on a chron-like cycle. they can call marine (rust) based services or javascript peers connected via nodejs.
